# How to Quickstart your own Docker Meetup Chapter?

Docker Chapter events are organized by community members who are interested in talking and learning about Docker. Anyone can start a Docker Chapter as long as there isn’t already a Docker Chapter group in your city. We simply ask our organizers to comply with our Code of Conduct and work with them to ensure everyone in the community is feeling welcome!

# How many attendees usually attend Docker Chapter meetups?
Docker chapter events range from 30 to 400 attendees depending on the popularity of Docker in your city and the size of the venue we find to accommodate the meetups.

# What’s the standard format of a Docker Chapter event?
Docker community events are usually two or three hours long and start between 4pm and 7pm. We usually have from 1 to up to 3 main talks of about 30 minutes but sometimes adjust the agenda to accommodate 10 minutes lightning talks.

# What are the typical first steps after the chapter page is live?
Post a message on one or all of the following Docker User channels including a link to your new meetup group: #Docker on IRC, Docker on Linkedin, Docker on Google+, Docker on Reddit,
Create a Twitter handle for your group and ping @docker to get retweets
Send an email to the docker-users mailing list including the link to your new Meetup group.
Look for a company willing to provide the venue for the meetup
Find a date for the first meetup that does not compete with other groups
Look for potential speakers living in your city

# Am I allowed to use the Docker logo ?
You are allowed to use the Docker logo on the chapter group page as long as you respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct). Check out our [brand guidlines](https://www.docker.com/brand-guidelines) and the [Docker media kit](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/legal/docker_logos_2018.zip) to choose which versions of the Docker logo you’d like to use.

# What happens if I no longer have time to run a Docker chapter group?
We really appreciate all the contributions Docker Community Leaders make to the Docker community. Although we hope to collaborate with you in the long term, we totally understand it if you have to step down as an organizer, just reach out and let us know whether or not you’ve found a substitute. Reach out to the Docker team and we can help find someone who wants to step up and help organize events moving forward. 

# Who should I contact if I my company wants to host / sponsor a Chapter event?

If your company is willing to sponsor a local Docker Chapter Group, please fill out [this form](https://docker.mobilize.io/entities/2371/registrations) or contact the local organizers directly via events.docker.com
