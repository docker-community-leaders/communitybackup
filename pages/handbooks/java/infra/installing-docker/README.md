### Install Docker

Docker runs natively on Mac, Windows and Linux.
This lab will use [Docker Community Edition (CE)](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).
Download the Docker CE edition for your machine from the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community).

_NOTE_: Docker CE requires a fairly recent operating system version.
If your machine does not meet the requirements, then you need to install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

This workshop is tested with Docker Community Edition `17.09.0-ce-rc2, build 363a3e7` on Mac OS X `10.12.5`.
