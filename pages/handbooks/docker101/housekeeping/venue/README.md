## Things to consider when searching for a venue

Choosing a venue for a workshop has the largest impact on your event. Hence, it is essential to plan and decide on the dates, place and amenities for a successful workshop. Here are few important considerations, community leaders should consider when searching for a venue:



### #1  Book a venue 2-3 months in advance

Book a venue at least 2-3 months in advance so that you will have enough time to plan for critical things, such as venue space, event page, and websites.


### #2 Find a location

Try your best to look out for a venue within a reasonable distance from most attendees’ homes or places of work. Ensure that there is a proper WiFi connectivity in the premises.

### #3 Parking

It's always good to reserve nearby parking lots for your attendees. It is equally important to either include the cost in the ticket prices, or have attendees pay when they park.

### #4 Capacity and Minimums

It is important to be able to make an estimation based on the number of registration for an event. Hence, capacity planning is an essential thing to plan beforehand.

### #5 Cost(optional)

Being flexible on the event date can be a great way to negotiate with venues. They may have open dates on their calendar that they want to fill. By providing 2-3 date options, you are more likely to get discounted pricing.


## Tips to search for a venue

Finding the right venue for your event can take up quite a bit of your time. Thankfully there are a few shortcuts to help you save time:

- Ask the community members if their organization would be interested to host the workshop for FREE.
- Contact the area’s local Convention & Visitor’s Bureau to inquire about venues that best suit your needs.
- On event listing websites, such as 10 times, eventful, etc., find similar local events to yours and see where they host events.
- Use an online tool, such as Unique Venues, EventUp, weworks etc. They help you parse through the many venues to find the one right for you.
